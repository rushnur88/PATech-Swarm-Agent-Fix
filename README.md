# PATech Swarm Agent Fix

This repository contains the fixed version of the PATech Labs website's SwarmAgent system for article generation.

## Key Issues Fixed

1. **Client/Server Component Error** - Resolved the error: "Attempted to call structureArticleFromRaw() from the server but structureArticleFromRaw is on the client"
   
2. **Improved Article Generation** - Enhanced the article generation system to better parse topics and create SEO-friendly content

3. **Guaranteed Article Generation** - Implemented a fallback system that ensures articles are always generated with sufficient word count (800+ words)

## Implementation Details

The main fixes involved:
- Moving shared functions to a separate utility file that can be used on both client and server
- Updating the `createGuaranteedArticle` function to better extract topics from prompts
- Ensuring proper formatting and word count for generated articles

## Original Issue

The SwarmAgent system was failing to generate proper articles because:
- Functions were being called across client/server boundaries
- Agent roles weren't properly defined
- Generated content was too short (300-400 words) when requirements specified 800+ words
